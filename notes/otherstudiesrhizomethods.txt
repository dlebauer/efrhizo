Arnone 2000 (Switzerland)
	1 tube/plot
	18 cm deep, 45 frames
	Used all 45 for RLD, 3 frames (3,9,15 cm) for root prod/mortality in first 10 samplings
Pritchard (Duke FACE): 
	30 cm vertical insertion at 45 deg 
	30/cos(45) ~= 42 cm tube in ground 
	monthly imaging for 6 years
	16 images/tube ~= 2.6 cm spacing
		=> Probably analyzed every two positions (27 mm)

Prichard (artificial pine)
	32.5 cm vertical, 45 deg
	32.5/cos(45) ~= 46 cm
	images every 3 weeks x7
	46/ 17 frames =2.7
		=> every other 


Baronti (Italian mini FACE):
	2 tubes/ring
	biomass reported as 0-15 & 015-30 cm
	Root #s reported per tube
	
Brown 2009 (open-topped chambers in FL)
	Lumps values for whole 1-m tube

Edwards 2004 (shading)
	2/plot
	monitored only 4 & 11 cm

Gill 2002 (shortgrass steppe)
	8 tubes
	5 samplings/season
	Analyzed RLD over 20-cm increments, unclear how many images/increment
	
Higgins 2002 (Jasper Ridge open-top chambers)
	Images every cm to 20 cm depth
	analyzed central area (10.86x14.49 out of 13.5x18)
	rejected frames with >5% bad soil contact
	4 depth zones (5 cm increments down tube starting at 8 cm), analyzed best frame/zone
