What would a Bayesian model for rhizotron data look like?

data ~ norm(0,sig_data) around the process model

process model:
	Root density ~ 	lognorm(mu_dens, sig_dens)
	mu_dens ~ lognorm(mu_depth, sig_depth)

	Should length and width be separate distributions? Dependent or independent?


2015-07-09: Noting for my future reference that there was some discussion of zero-inflating continuous models on R-sig-ME. Started June 17 under the heading "Building glmms to handle zero-inflated continuous data in R - what options are available? (especially relating to hurdle/mixture models)". One suggestion to try the gamlss package, and one suggestion from Gavin Simpson copied in full below:
	How complex are the random effects? I they are relatively simple, give the
	mgcv package a look. Its gam() function can fit Tweedie models optimising
	over the Tweedie parameter too, and you can include random effects via
	splines using `bs = "re"`.
