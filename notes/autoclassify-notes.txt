Totally unvetted half-asleep notion for how to automatically classify roots

Starting from a directory of WinRhizo-traced root images, we have:

	* images with a uniform naming scheme; note for later that not all are from the same experimental unit, and the classifier may need to be trained differently fro some than others.

	* A data file containing hand-traced dimensions for each image, taken as canonical. Level of detail in logging is configurable -- it's possible to save every root segment, each whole root, or just frame totals. Will assume for starters that frame totals are good enough, but we can revisit that if needed.

	* Pattern files for each image, describing start/end coordinate and diameters for each (Assumed cylindrical) root segment.

Procedure:

	* load each image, 
	* use the pattern file to divide it into root and nonroot pixels
	* Magic happens here: find differences between root and nonroot. Possible requirements:
		-- brightness threshold
		-- color distinctions: Perhaps whiteness (i.e. evenness of R,G,B values?) vs. soil colors (mostly red?)
		-- shape restrictions -- roots wiggle, but are generally long and skinny.
