2014-03-19: 
	Raw data file ef2010.05.24.TXT ends with 499 blank lines (some empty, some with varying numbers of tabs). Cause unknown, but present in version on tracing computer as well. Hoping these won't show up in any future versions, but tweaked the sed call to remove blank lines from any WinRhizo file (sed -E -e '/^[[:space:]]+$/d') while collecting frame totals. 
	While I'm at it, moved the sed call out of Makefile into a separate script.
