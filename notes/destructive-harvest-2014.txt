Rhizotron destructive harvest:

The basic question: We want to know whether soil in the immediate vicinity of rhizotron tubes has the same density of roots as the bulk soil away from the tube. 

To answer this, between 2014-09-16 and 2014-09-19 we selected six individual minirhizotron tubes and excavated a series of small soil monoliths from the soil immediately touching the tube ("near" -- includes all roots actually photographed by the camera) and from bulk soil >40 cm from the tube.

Immediately before collecting the monoliths, we collected a full final set of images from the tube using the minirhizotron camera. These images are saved on the IGB fileserver with the experiment name "EFDESTRUCTIVE". We also recorded the "offset" (length of the tube projecting above the soil surface) before disturbing the soil surface. The vertical depth below the surface for each image collected can then be calculated by noting that the tube is installed 30 degrees (=30*2pi/360 radians) from horizontal, the first image is collected 22.2 cm below the top of the tube, and images are spaced 1.35 cm apart: depth = cos(30*2pi/260)* (1.35*(location number) - (offset - 22.2)) 

We also clipped all aboveground biomass from a 60x60 cm quadrat placed with its near edge centered on the point where the front face of the tube entered the soil. Biomass from the halves of the quadrat nearer and further from the tube were collected separately, oven-dried to constant mass, weighed in their bag, then disposed of and the weight of each empty bag was recorded and subtracted from the sample weight. All weights were recorded on 2014-10-20 by CKB.

Six monoliths were collected from the imaged face of each tube at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25, and 25-30 cm *along the angled tube midline*. Converting these to vertical depth as (30*2pi/260)*depth, this gives depth horizons of approximately 0-4.3, 4.3-8.7, 8.7-13, 13-17.3, 17.3-21.7, and 21.7-26.0 cm. Six additional monoliths were collected from bulk soil approximately 40 cm from the tube, within the "far" half of the quadrat. Far-from-tube horizons were collected vertically at 4.5 cm increments rather than at an angle and each monolith was a rectangular 5 * 5 * 4.5 = 112.5 cm^3 solid with no cutouts, giving vertical depth horizons of 0-4.5, 4.5-9, 9-13.5, 13.5-18, 18-22.5, and 22.5-27 cm.

Monoliths from near tubes were removed in the form of truncated rectangular solids where the back edge was the centerline of the tube, the front edge was 5 cm from the front edge of the tube, the top and bottom were cut at right angles to the tube at 5 cm increments along the angled tube face (*not* vertical depth), and sides were cut parallel to the 5.72 cm diameter of the tube. Therefore the collected monoliths had dimensions of 5.72 * 5 * (5 + 2.86)  = 224.80 cm^3 , minus a 57.2 mm semicylinder from one 5 x 5.72 cm back edge (the area occupied by the tube), for a total volume of (224.80 - 0.5*(pi*(5.72/2)^2 * 5) = 160.56 cm^3. Additionally, every monolith from the 0-5 cm horizon intersected the soil surface at the front face of the tube at an angle 30 degrees from horizontal, so its volume was reduced by a wedge with dimensions (5 * 5.72 * (5*tan(30*2pi/360)))/2 = 41.28 cm^3, increased by a wedge with dimension (2.86 * 5.72 * (2.86* tan(30*2pi/360))/2 = 13.51 cm^3, and decreased by the cylindrical-hoof section of the tube that falls within the volume of this second wedge, with height 2.86* tan(30*2pi/360) = 1.65 cm and radius 2.86 cm, for a volume of 2/3hr^2 = 2/3*1.65*2.86^2 = 9.00 cm^3. Thus the total volume for 0-5 cm near-tube monoliths was 160.56 - 41.28 + 13.51 - 9.00 = 123.79 cm^3.

Got all that? To recap: Monoliths from near the tube were 160.56 cm^3 except the surface (0-4.3 cm depth) horizon, which was 123.79 cm^3. All far-from-tube monoliths were 112.5 cm^3.

After collection, monoliths were placed in 1-gallon Ziplok bags and stored at 4 °C until washed, which was a long time later because Chris had a bad month of migraines. To wash each sample, the bag was weighed, then water was added to the bag a quart or so at a time and the sample was agitated to break up the soil. Suspended clay and organic matter was repeatedly washed through progressively finer sieves until roots and fine sand were collected on a 0.25-mm seive. Coarse sand and rocks were kept in the bag until the rinse water ran clear, then transferred to a dish and remaining roots were floated off or manually removed with tweezers. Roots and fine sand were separated by repeated floating and screening, then all root material was collected by straining through a 53-micron cloth. Roots were blotted dry, transferred to paper coin envelopes, dried at 60 °C to constant mass (overnight or longer), and the entire envelope was weighed. To calculate dry root mass, subtract 1.43 g (mean of 10 coin envelopes, range 1.40-1.45 g) from each recorded root weight.

All collection dates, tube offsets, wet and dry weights, and root-washing dates are stored in rhizo-destructive-belowground.csv. Mass of aboveground samples are in rhizo-destructive-aboveground.csv. Tube offsets and camera notes are in rhizo-destructive-tubenotes.csv. Harvest date is duplicated everywhere. All weights in both files are in grams. Notes on data columns:

* whole fresh wt with bag g: Sample + 1-gallon Ziplok bag, weighed immediately before washing.
* root dry wt with envelope g: dry roots + coin envelope. Envelope assumed 1.43 g.

* AG biomass wt with bag g: dry aboveground material, including bag.
AG bag wt g: mass of empty bag from this aboveground biomass sample -- subtract from previous column to get dry biomass.

* Tube offset: Length in cm along the rhizotron tube (30° from vertical) from soil surface to top edge of tube. Note that this is NOT the vertical height from soil to top of tube -- if you need that number for anything, compute it as (offset*cos(30*2pi/360)).

Decided 2014-11-21 that 1.43 g per envelope assumption was not precise enough. Returned all samples to oven overnight, reweighed 2014-11-22 on a more sensitive scale. Roots were weighed in tared metal weigh boats, envelopes weighed empty. 
	* Mean envelope weight was 1.404 g--apparently the envelopes on the shelf contained about 30 mg water when we were computing "average" weight!
	* envelope weight increased with time since removal from the oven, from ~1.395 fresh out of oven to ~1.415 28 samples (~85 minutes) later. Presumably the samples also took on water in this time, but the differences will be on the order of milligrams, so I'll ignore them. 
	* Did not record exact time out of oven, but "weigh order" is the sequence I weighed them in. All samples weighed the afternoon of 2014-11-22, returning unweighed ones to the oven twice: 20 min for lunch between 24th and 25th-weighed samples, 21 min for coffee between 52nd and 53rd samples. 
	* Moved previously recorded weights to rhizo-destructive-belowground-envel-wt-est.csv, replaced root and envelope masses in rhizo-destructive-belowground.csv with reweighed values.
