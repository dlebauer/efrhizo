	Analayzing 2009-08-26 EF rhizotron data (NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT VERSION -- I didn't check whether this is the same as the version in the restored files). Followed /Users/chrisb/UI/energy farm/rhizotron data/dataprocessing.txt through step 4, am trying to check for duplicates. Have removed "easy" dups, i.e. the ones that differ in MeasDate and MeasTime but nowhere else. Have list of tube/location combinations where dups remain. 
	Tube 28: location 70 updated, last entry OK
	Tube 29: Locations 5,10 updated, last entry OK
		Location 15: Looks identical-except-date-and-time. I'm looking at the raw data rather than the set with the dups removed, so this just means the image was opened and not updated in winRhizo, right?

	Comparing directory contents of restored and unrestored rhizotron data directories (user rhizotron, directory "Desktop\Energy Farm Rhizotron". For shorthand, "restored" means the version that just came out of the backup file, "orig" means the version that was on the computer before, even though in some cases the "orig" version may be newer. Woo, confusion.
	 Note that Ahbi reports there are also some 2009 analyses on the imager computer where 2010 analysis is being done; haven't checked those yet.
	
	calibration:
		2 files in restored that weren't in orig. Copied them over and now they match.
	data:
		"amdtest.TXT" was in restored but not orig; copied to match. All 4 now files in the directory appear to contain root length data from 2009-06-05:
		"amdtest.TXT"
			tubes 1 & 12
		"EF09.TXT"
			tubes 1 & 2
		"eftest.TXT"
			tube 26 loc 5, several locations form tube 97 
		"tmp.TXT"
			tube 1 loc 22
	EF2009-06-05:
		Restored version has many more .pat files, but no winrhizo file present in either version. Where is it? In data directory and extremely fragmentary, apparently.
			pat files are from tubes 1,2, and 12.
	EF2009-06-17:
		Restored version has winrhizo data file and many more .pat files. 
	EF2009-7-24:
		identical except thumbs.db, no pat files or winrhizo data in either.
	EF2009-8-26: only in orig
		contains images from 44 tubes (+calibration). winrhizo file has frames from all of them.
	EF2010-05-24: only in orig
	EF2010-7-22: only in orig	
	Ref-images:
		identical
	Session 1:
		4 pat files differ (T1L8, T1L10, T1L11, T1L12). 99 more pat files in restored version. No winrhizo data file in either.
	winrhizo files:
		restored version contains "ef-winrhizo.CFG", orig doesn't. "demotest.TXT" is common to both and contains measurements for WinRhizo sample images plus 2009-06-05 tube 1.
