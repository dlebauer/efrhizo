The following numerical problems occured the indicated number of times after warmup on chain 1

Exception thrown at line 114: normal_log: Scale parameter is 0, but must be > 0!                1
When a numerical problem occurs, the Metropolis proposal gets rejected.
However, by design Metropolis proposals sometimes get rejected even when there are no numerical problems.
Thus, if the number in the 'count' column is small, do not ask about this message on stan-users.

When a numerical problem occurs, the Metropolis proposal gets rejected.
However, by design Metropolis proposals sometimes get rejected even when there are no numerical problems.
Thus, if the number in the 'count' column is small, do not ask about this message on stan-users.

Stan model 'mctd_foursurf' does not contain samples.

Warning messages:
1: In .local(object, ...) :
  some chains had errors; consider specifying chains = 1 to debug
2: There were 14 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.99 may help. 
3: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Jul 18 19:12:47 2016.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).
 The estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information is a measure of
 the efficiency of the sampler with values close to 1 being ideal.
 For each chain, these estimates are
