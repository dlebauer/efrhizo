New in 0.1-2:
	* Change in loc.to.depth calculations: Assumes 22 cm from tub of tube to CENTER of location 1, not to TOP of location as before. Depths calculated by 0.1-2 will NOT match those from previous versions.
New in 0.1-1: 
	* loc.to.depth gains two optional arguments, with defaults matching the values that were hard-coded in verrsion 0.1-0:
		- offset (in cm from top of tube to ground). Defaults to 22. 
		- angle (in degrees from vertical). Defaults to 30.
