Description: Some functions I use together for sorting, finding duplicates, rearranging, and plotting the DeLucia lab's minirhizotron data. Created partly because I was tired of functions filling my .GlobalEnvironment , partly because I wanted to learn how to make an R package, and only a tiny bit because it was useful.
