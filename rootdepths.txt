Maximum rooting depths \citep{canadell:1996cl}
	by biome 
		cropland 2.1 ± 0.2 m (max 3.7 m)
		temperate grassland 2.6 ± 0.2 m (max 6.3 m)
		tropical grass/savannah 15.0 ± 5.4 m (max 68 m)
		tundra 0.5 ± 0.1 m (max 0.9 m)
	By functional group:
		trees 7.0 ± 1.2 m
		shrubs 5.1 ± 0.8 m
		herbaceous 2.6 ± 0.1 m
	Glycine max: 1.8 m (from \citep{mayaki:1976mb})
	Zea Mays: 
		1.3 m from \citep{pages:1994cq}, 
		2.4 m from \citep{weaver:1926kh}
Root depths from a water-depletion experiment \citep{dardanelli:1997ay}
	Soy (3 maturity groups)
		85 day  130 cm
		112 day 190 cm
		128 day 230 cm
	Alfalfa 250 cm (mention Borg and Grimes report 3 to 6 m)
	Maize 190 cm


Evan said we "want to be sure we really need the extra depth."
	--What are the consequences of missing deep-root observations?
	--is absolute maximum root depth interesting to us?
	--if trying to calculate biomass: magnitude of potential error if roots deeper than 1.5 m are unquantifiable?
	
Candace says water table is at ~0.5 m. Prob. limits root depth? What about tube flooding?

Wageningen Rhizotron: 
	14-day interval between observations
	presented as # roots per cm^2 of tube surface (tubes are horizontal)

\citep{yang:2003ai}: Tube angle (30¡) is to discourage roots following tube.

Zhang 2009: Rhizotron numbers differed from soil core numbers for first few months. Endorse 10-month waiting period, say Johnson 2001 recommend waiting 6-12 months after tube installation. 
	One month with differing counts: Probably when fine roots were dying very rapidly. Issue of accurate ID of dead roots in rhizotron. (Check: Any reason to expect difference under UV light?)
	
Higher soil temp -> faster root turnover? \citep{hendrick:1993ul}
