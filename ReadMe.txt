Data and analyses for minirhizotron observations of roots at at the EBI Energy Farm, 2009-2014. 

Raw images and the pixel-by-pixel tracing data are not stored here -- those live on the DeLucia fileserver. The primary "raw" data here are the WinRhizo datafiles, which contain total length/area/volume and average width for each image, plus summaries of each root that are currently thrown out before analysis. 

The whole analysis is intended to be fully reproducible. If anything changes, whether in raw data or final figure presentation, running $(make) in this directory should produce a fully updated version of the results.

Chris has a manuscript in progress describing the project, but hasn't got his act together to put it online yet. Email chris@ckblack.org for a copy. Spoiler: Miscanthus has more roots than maize does, but where it allocates them may shock you!

Directory contents:

data: cleaned-up, finished, most authoritatize versions of datasets. Everything here is generated by some scripted process, NEVER by hand-editing. 
NOTE: Some contents of the stan/ subdirectory are not committed in Git, because the output from a full model run is 821 MB large and needs to be recreated from scratch every time the model updates. 
	* Included in the Git repository: Run logs, CSV summaries of posterior means/CIs of model parameters. 
	* Not included in the Git repository: 767 MB of Rdata files containing all HMC samples from each run, 51 MB of PNGs showing every diagnostic plot I could think of. I'm happy to share these with anyone who's interested -- email chris@ckblack.org if I haven't replaced this sentence with a link yet :)

figures: Graphics generated from the cleaned-up data. 
	* Everything in the top level of this directory here is autogenerated from the authoritative dataset whenever the Makefile is run.
	* Everything in the 'static' subdirectory is a hand-generated one-off, with code used to generate it if available.

images: Static images for presentation/manuscript purposes: sample root images, screenshots, images of fieldwork, etc.

Makefile: Script for the Unix 'make' utility, specifying how each component of the project depends on others and providing rules for how to automatically update each file when the files that it depends on have changed.

notes: Human-readable information. What I did, what I didn't do, reminders, to-do lists, etc.

operator-agreement: an **unfinished** sub-experiment asking "how similar are the data produced by different workers tracing the same images?" I'm now using these same images as a worker training battery. Analysis TK eventually. Nothing in this directory is updated by Make.

protocols: Field maps, instructions for camera operators, tube installation schematics...

rawdata: Uncleaned data in the form it came to me: WinRhizo files, hand-compiled spreadsheets. If anything in here needs to change, it probably means we had to redo a lot of hours of work.

scripts: Tools to automate the rest of the analysis. Mostly written in R, some in bash.

stan: Scripts for hierarchical Bayesian inference on how root volume differs between crops and over time, written in the probabalistic programming language Stan. Also contains R and Bash scripts to handle the process of running the models on the IGB computing cluster or, with patience, on a sufficiently powerful laptop. TODO: Consolidate contents into scripts/? 

tmp: Things I don't intend to keep but am not deleting just yet, e.g. logged debugging output. This directory is ignored by git.
