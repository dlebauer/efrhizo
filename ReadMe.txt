This directory contains data and analyses for minirhizotron observations of roots at at the EBI Energy Farm, 2009-2014. 

Raw images and the pixel-by-pixel tracing data are not stored here -- find those on the fileserver. The primary "raw" data here are the WinRhizo datafiles, which contain total length/area/volume and average width for each image and summaries of each root that are currently thrown out before analysis. 

The whole analysis is intended to be fully reproducible. If anything changes, whether in raw data or final figure presentation, running $(make) in this directory should produce a fully updated version of the results.

This directory is also a Git repository, so you can see exactly what I did and when.

Directory contents:

data: cleaned-up, finished, most authoritatize versions of datasets. Everything* here is generated by some scripted process, NEVER by hand-editing. 
	*EXCEPTION: as of 2016-01-09, subdirectory `2012` still contains two hand-edited Excel spreadsheets that were used to work out imagename corrections for 2012, which will probably live in `notes/` someday but maybe they need to be in a more useful format first.

figures: Graphics generated from the cleaned-up data. 
	* Everything in the top level of this directory here is autogenerated from the authoritative dataset whenever the Makefile is run.
	* Everything in the 'static' subdirectory is a hand-generated one-off, with code used to generate it if available.

images: Static images for presentation/manuscript purposes: sample root images, screenshots, images of fieldwork, etc.

Makefile: Script for the Unix 'make' utility, specifying how each component of the project depends on others and providing rules for how to automatically update each file when the files that it depends on have changed.

notes: Human-readable information. What I did, what I didn't do, reminders, to-do lists, etc.

operator-agreement: a sub-experiment asking "how similar are the data produced by different workers tracing the same images?" I'm now using these same images as a worker training battery. Nothing in here is updated by Make.

protocols: Field maps, instructions for camera operators, tube installation schematics...

rawdata: Uncleaned data in the form it came to me: WinRhizo files, hand-compiled spreadsheets. If anything in here needs to change, it probably means we had to redo a lot of hours of work.

scripts: Tools to automate the rest of the analysis. Mostly written in R, some in bash.

stan: Scripts for hierarchical Bayesian inference on how root volume differs between crops and over time, written in the probabalistic programming language Stan. Also contains R and Bash scripts to handle the process of running the models on the IGB computing cluster; 
	N.B. 1: These models are NOT yet run automatically by Make, and as of 2016-01-09 the output isn't yet saved in the Git repository. Be sure to rerun the models after any update to the data.
	N.B. 2: As of 2016-01-09 these scripts produce copious debugging output -- on the order of 120 GB from a single run if using the whole dataset! Seriously, don't try to run these on a laptop unless you're taking a very small subset and/or turning off sample logging.

tmp: Things I don't intend to keep but am not deleting just yet, e.g. logged debugging output. This directory is ignored by git.
