# 2015-02-25:

Cleaning up uncommitted changes left from last time I worked in this directory, which was while preparing a poster for department Fall Welcome in September 2014. 

* scripts/plot-ebireportspring2014.r updated for a nicer color scheme in 2010 & 2012 polynomial fit plots. 2012 all-points-scattered plots change slightly because of different margins, but no change in color scale. Committed updated versions of all output plots. Did NOT commit a few additional lines of code that produced both polynomial plots side-by-side in one file. Pasting here for the record:
	require(gridExtra)
	png(
		filename="figures/logvol-polyfit-2010and2012.png",
		width=16,
		height=8,
		units="in",
		res=300)
	grid.arrange(p10,p12, ncol=2)
	dev.off()

* protocols/rhizotron-imaging-prot-20140602.tex is a revision of the imaging protocol written for 2014 when I supposed to be collecting weekly measurements of only the block 0 tubes. The only images collected were June (CKB) and August (CKB, TLP, TAW) and this protocol was never deployed, but committing for future reference.

* scripts/sitedups.py is a Python script for finding duplicate images, i.e. those that share the same tube, location, and session number. I whipped it up while checking 2013 images two weeks ago and did not commit it at the time; fixing that now.

* Added this file. No more excuses for wondering why I did that thing.

* Makefile was missing prerequisites -- cleaned data files for `frametotals*.txt` and `stripped*.txt`  failed to list their processing scripts in prerequisite lists. Fixed that, remade all outputs.

* Gah, cleanup.r produces a lot of error messages. Need to clean these up eventually, but meanwhile let's save them somewhere instead of flooding the console. Piped these outputs to a new `tmp/` directory, added it to `.gitignore`, documented it in `ReadMe.txt` as the place for temporary output you're not wuite done with.

...Why are so many of these "multiple calibrations" messages listing numbers that look identical? A typical example:
	`[1] "EF2012_T096_L100_2012.10.25_103258_006_MDM.jpg : multiple cals. PxSizeH:  0.022663, 0.022663, 0.022663, 0.022663 , PxSizeV:  0.022026, 0.022026, 0.022026, 0.022026"`
Those pixel sizes look identical to me and they should to `strip.tracing.dups()` as well. Investigating... And here's the place where I compare PxSizeV against PxSizeH[1] instead of PxSizeV[1]. Fixed that, rebuilt RhizoFuncs package, reran cleanup scripts, calibration messages dropped dramatically from 1041 to 327 lines in 2010 and from 6430 to 2338 lines in 2012. That's still a lot of errors, but much better!

A sidetrack: Spent a while documenting what I can see of the file format for WinRhizo patterns files. Not yet reverse-engineered well enough to reconstruct the trace images confidently outside of WinRhino, but it's a start. See `notes/patfile-notes.txt` for details.

Updating 2012 data files. Have brought over the most recent versions of at least S1, S5, S6 (possibly not the "found in notes" S6 file, though). Am too tired to trust my evaluation of the changes before committing -- in particular, make sure line endings and sort order aren't inflating the changeset. 

Manually added updated censoring for session 1; this too needs checking when I'm better rested. Menu for tomorrow before committing these changes:
	-- confirm that all raw data files are updated.
	-- check for line ending issues in raw data files.
	-- check S1 frame censoring records, add them for other sessions.
	-- copy in updated analysis logs.
